# My New Portfolio - Next.js & GSAP Experiments

Welcome to **My New Portfolio**, a personal web project built to showcase my work and experiment with advanced web animations.  
This site serves as a creative playground to explore **GSAP** motion effects, **scroll-based interactions**, and **Next.js** development.

## Description

This portfolio was developed to present my professional projects and creative experiments.  
It also serves as a technical lab where I test new frontend technologies, focusing on **animation performance**, **smooth scroll experiences**, and **responsive design** using **Next.js** and **GSAP**.

The website is deployed and publicly accessible at:  
👉 [new-portfolio-cristina.netlify.app](https://new-portfolio-cristina.netlify.app)

## Features

- Built with **Next.js** for performance and scalability.  
- **GSAP** for complex motion and scroll-triggered animations.  
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile.  
- Deployed via **Netlify**.  
- Modular components structure following best React practices.

## Usage

Clone the repository and install dependencies to run it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cristinaAlarcon98/myNewPortfolio.git
cd myNewPortfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:
- Integrating **GSAP** animations in a **Next.js** environment.  
- Creating smooth scrolling and scroll-based effects.  
- Structuring reusable React components for portfolio pages.  
- Deploying and maintaining a project on **Netlify**.
